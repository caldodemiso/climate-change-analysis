# 🌍 Climate Change Tempo-Spatial Analysis with Hadoop & HiveQL

This project analyzes global land temperature data from 1750–2015 using HiveQL on a Hadoop cluster. We explore both **temporal** (year-based) and **spatial** (country-based) patterns, then visualize insights with **Power BI (Web)**.

## 🔧 Tools & Tech Used

- **Apache Hadoop** (HDFS)
- **Apache Hive** (HiveQL via Beeline)
- **Power BI (Browser Version)**
- **Excel** for CSV cleaning and conversion
- **Secure Shell (SSH)** & **SCP** for file transfers

## 📊 Dataset

- **Name**: Global Land Temperatures by Country  
- **Source**: [Kaggle – Berkeley Earth](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data)  
- **Size**: ~9MB CSV

## 📈 Sample Visualizations

- `visuals/tempo_chart.png` → Avg. temperature per year (line chart)  
- `visuals/spatial_chart.png` → Avg. temperature per country (bar chart)

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- Global average temperature has steadily increased since the 1900s
- Specific regions have warmed more dramatically than others
- Data preprocessing is critical to accurate analysis in Big Data workflows
